       <h2>Thou shalt not lie, minimalists</h2>
       <p>When you lie to someone, you have to remember the lie. You first need to create the details of the lie and then imprint them somewhere on your brain. If the same topic is ever discussed again, you have to go back to the imprint and repeat the lie. If you get the details wrong, your lie might get exposed.</p>
       <p>Truth, on the other hand, doesn’t need to be remembered. If you forget how or why something happened, you can simply say I don’t remember.</p>
       <p>Lies take up cognitive load, truths don’t.</p>
       <p>Every lie is a car which you have to park somewhere in your brain. When needed, you will have to recall the directions to the parking spot. If you can’t recall, they’ll know you lied.</p>
    <p>Every truth is a taxi ride. You commute, you pay for the ride, and then you forget about it. Who remembers how many taxi rides they have taken in their lifetime?</p>
    <p>And one lie doesn’t take just one parking spot. We often have to lie many times to hide one lie. So, one parking spot grows to many parking spots over time. A truth, in comparison, is complete in itself. It doesn’t need to procreate.</p>
    <p>A lie leads to mess. A truth creates a beautiful design for a moment and then it vanishes.</p>
    <p>That should be enough to conclude: minimalists, thou shalt not lie.</p>
